        <h4>What are the differences between a Telecaster and a Stratocaster?</h4>

        <p>
            Telecaster and Stratocaster are two different types of electric guitars. Both are very similar to each other
            in a lot of
            ways but to the trained ear there is a very big difference. The easiest way to tell the difference between
            the guitars
            is by the appearance of them.

        <p>
            As you can see the pick-guard has a flat edge on the bottom and the knobs on the side are vertically
            aligned. There is
            also typically only one pickup on these guitars which is one of the reasons that the guitar has such a
            unique twangy
            sound to them

        <p>As you can see the pick-guard has a curved edge and the knobs are not aligned with each other. Statocaster
            guitars have
            multiple pickups which allows you to change the sound of the guitar more which makes them a bit more
            versatile.
            Stratocaster guitars are the most popular form of electric guitar and are great for beginners that are
            trying to get
            into playing electric guitar.</p>

        <h4>What is my personal favorite?</h4>

        <p>Right now I have been mainly playing on my new G&L Telecaster.</p>

        <p class="italics">Here is a picture of it:</p>

        <div class="fade-container">

                <div class="text">G&L Telecaster</div>
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>I got this used at a local music shop called The Trading Musician and I have been loving it. It has a great
            sound and is
            very easy to play. I would highly recommend this guitar to anyone that is looking for a good starter guitar.
